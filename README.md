# Surveillance-Video-Analysis
Implemented a Single Shot MultiBox Detector(SSD) model with a line of counting approach to detect and count vehicles and people in surveillance videos, for efficient traffic signal prioritization and crowd management respectively.

Added features like license plate extraction from surveillance videos by implementing Tesseract Optical Character Recognition and tested the working on Indian license plates, providing an accuracy of 96% in detecting the characters.

Developed an Android application as the interface for communication between user and the model running on Flask server.
